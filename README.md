# Data structures and Algorithm problems repository
Problems are picked from Leetcode, Interviewbit and their solutions are mostly in c++/java.

Each problem is solved in different file.

cpp folder contains solutions written in c++ using c++17 standards.
Command to compile a cpp program: g++ -std=c++17 Filename.cpp
Run cpp program:  ./a.out

java folder is a IntelliJ Java project using command line template. JUnit test cases are added for few problems instead of writing main method for testing.
Open the java folder in IntelliJ.
Programs which have a test file created can be tested using test file and test methods.
Programs which don't have a test file can be run like normal java program since it has main method.
For newer programs please write test files/methods for testing instead of main method.
